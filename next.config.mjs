  // during the "Linting and checking validity of types" phase — webpack
  // compiles fine, then `tsc` blows the heap and the build dies before
  // writing .next/BUILD_ID, leaving a broken deploy.
  //
  // This is SAFE because types and lint are verified locally (and should be
  // in CI) via `tsc --noEmit` / `next lint` before every push — we don't
  // need to re-run them inside the memory-constrained production build.
